A big congratulations to Marlon James. His third novel to be published, A Brief History of Seven Killings, has beaten the rest of the long list and short list to the top.

Here are some positive review snippets:

‘Vast and vastly ambitious... much to admire...fascinating...the author's imaginative and stylistic range are impressive.’ _Sunday Times_

‘It’s like a Tarantino remake of “The Harder They Come” but with a soundtrack by Bob Marley and a script by Oliver Stone and William Faulkner, with maybe a little creative boost from some primo ganja. It’s epic in every sense of that word: sweeping, mythic, over-the-top, colossal and dizzyingly complex. It’s also raw, dense, violent, scalding, darkly comic, exhilarating and exhausting – a testament to Mr. James’s vaulting ambition and prodigious talent.’ Michiko Kakutani, _New York Times_

‘Marlon James’s writing can be at once punchy and lyrical; can alternate strange, dreamy poetry with visceral action; and can bring persuasive life to a kaleidoscopic range of characters. His gifts are expansive…Extraordinary...a writer whose importance can scarcely be questioned.’ _Independent_

‘A vivid novel that deserves all the praise it has received.’ _Sunday Telegraph_

‘This seething, hot, violent, action-packed novel is enormous in every sense…the ambition is huge, but \[James\] pulls it off with huge style, confidence, imagination and wit...Extraordinary.’_The Times_

‘When reading reviews of _The Book of Night Women_, James apparently became bored with comparisons to Toni Morrison; and with _A Brief History_, he’s got bored with comparisons to Quentin Tarantino. But it is hard not to see the strength of that comparison. This is a novel that explores the aesthetics of cacophony and also the aesthetics of violence.’ _Guardian_

‘James has triumphed in capturing the tension, the politics, the heat, chaos, beauty and music of Jamaica.’ _Financial Times_

‘A vivid plunge into a crazed, violent and corrupt world, told through multiple narrators and executed with swaggering aplomb…the most original novel I’ve read in years.’ Irvine Welsh

‘With comparisons to the works of David Foster Wallace and Quentin Tarantino, James has garnered the highest of contemporary praise.’ _Wired_

‘Breaks new ground…a very fluid and superbly controlled work.’ _Spectator_

‘Manages consistently to shock and mesmerise at the same time…Best of all is the dialogue …its musicality is tinged with menace…this tale of a country and its people ravaged and transformed by tragedy packs quite a punch.’ _The Economist_

‘A prismatic story of gang violence and Cold War politics in a turbulent post-independence Jamaica.’ _The New Yorker_

‘_A Brief History of Seven Killings_ is a masterpiece.’ Chris Salewicz

‘This novel cracks open a world that needs to be known. It's scary and lyrically beautiful – you'll want to read whole pages aloud to strangers.’ Russell Banks

‘Marlon James has done a hard thing. He's taken a complex, myth-like chapter in the story of an international legend, and given it new life...Poetic, vivid, this is a deeply entertaining read.’_ShortList_

‘An excellent new work of historical fiction…part crime thriller, part oral history, part stream-of-consciousness monologue.’ _Rolling Stone_

‘Thrilling, ambitious…Both intense and epic.’ _Los Angeles Times_ ‘A tour de force…an audacious, demanding, inventive literary work.’ _Wall Street Journal_, Best Books of 2014

‘Epic, immersive, acutely observed and deeply moving, it’s worth every long hour it demands of the reader…James’s meticulous characterization makes his writing exceptionally vivid and compelling …a brilliant, heartbreaking and searing \[novel\] that will burrow its way deep into the reader’s soul.’ _Huffington Post_, Best Books of 2014

‘James’s sprawling, daunting, messy effort is a great – if grim – success…Brilliant.’ _New Statesman_

‘This is the go-for-broke BIG BOOK of the year, a vast, challenging kaleidoscopic historical novel, as told from the edges of history. Hilary Mantel would approve.’ _Chicago Tribune_

‘The hottest name in Caribbean literature right now.’ _GQ_, Best Books of 2014

‘It may sound daunting, but the way James uses language is amazing … Vigorous, intricate and captivating, _A Brief History of Seven Killings_ is hard to put down. Book clubs come running.’_Ebony_

‘This compelling, not-so-brief history brings off a social portrait worthy of Diego Rivera, antic and engagé, a fascinating tangle of the naked and the dead.’ _Washington Post_, Best Books of 2014

‘James has written a dangerous book, one full of lore and whispers and history … a great book.’ _Boston Globe_, Best Books of 2014

‘An exuberant, Balzacian novel by a self-described ‘post-post colonialist’ writer who is at ease with several canons, traditions and dialects. You’ll also find a political novel on the level of Don DeLillo. It’s the rare ‘revelation’ that will easily outlive its hype-cycle.’ _Flavorwire_

‘Nothing short of awe-inspiring.’ _Entertainment Weekly_

‘This novel should be required reading.’ _Publishers Weekly_, Best Books of 2014

‘\[A\] magisterial, viscerally lyric epic…The sharp-edged pleasures of this book come from its protean, potent language. Each of James’s characters speaks in a distinct (though sometimes shifting) voice and dialect…\[like\] reading a pulp fiction version of Faulkner’s _The Sound and the Fury.’ Barnes & Noble Review_

‘A brilliant novel, highly recommended; one of those big, rich, magisterial works that lets us into a world we really don’t know.’ _Library Journal_
