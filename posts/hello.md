I have two vices.

Books. and Coffee.

I don't discriminate when it comes to reading material.

Fiction, non-fiction. Short stories, epic poetry. Graphic novels and graphic descriptions.

These are all my kind of reading, as are so many others. In this blog I will try to map my literary life, I may post ponderings, paragraphs or even pages of my thoughts and ideas.

Hopefully you'll find them interesting, valid or maybe argumentative and provoking.

However you find it, let me know with a comment, a tweet, a like or share. I'll do my best to reply and engage whenever I can.

Oh, yeah and then there's coffee! Black or milky, sweet or sharp, warm or iced... It's all good!

Let me know your favourite books and coffee in the comments!?
