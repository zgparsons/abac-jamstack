Today, the Man Booker Prize has announced their short list for the 2015 award. Previous winners include many prestigious authors such as William Golding, Salman Rushdie, J. M. Coetzee (x2) and Margaret Atwood.

You can see the long list, announced back in July, [here on the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/29/man-booker-prize-2015-the-longlist-in-pictures).

Previously, the Man Booker Prize has only been open to those from the UK and Commonwealth countries. In 2014 though, the gates were opened to all English-language writers (as long as the book had been published in the UK too). The 2015 short list certainly reflects this with two authors from the US, Jamaican author Marlon James and Nigerian Chigozie Obioma. Obioma's novel is also his debut work.

The prize panel will now decide which of these authors deserves both the £50,000 prize money, and the prestige that comes with it!

The finalists of the Man Booker Prize 2015:

**_Satin Island_ by Tom McCarthy (UK) **

**_A Brief History of Seven Killings_ by Marlon James (Jamaica) **

**_A Spool of Blue Thread_ by Anne Tyler (US) **

**_The Year of the Runaways_ by Sunjeev Sahota (UK)**

**_A Little Life_ by Hanya Yanagihara (US) **

**_The Fishermen_ by Chigozie Obioma (Nigeria)**

AlwaysBooks wishes congratulations and good luck to all of the finalists!
